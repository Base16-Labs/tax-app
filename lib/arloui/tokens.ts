 * Translucent surface fallbacks for glass-like navigation and controls.
 * A platform-native Liquid Glass treatment can replace the surface on supported
 * iOS versions without changing the surrounding component contract.
 *
 * Dark overlays run on Zinc-900 `#18181B`, matching the dark surface swap. They
 * were left on Grey-900 `#101828`, whose blue tint reads as navy the moment the
 * material sits over anything that isn't already dark — a glass nav bar drifting
 * across coloured content picked up a visible cast. Zinc is hue-neutral, so the
 * material now only darkens what passes underneath.
 *
 * ## `tintOpacity` · `tintOpacityPressed`
 *
 * How much of a component's own colour survives the material. Untinted glass is
 * colourless by construction, so a glass primary button would read as "some
 * translucent thing with blue text" rather than as the primary button — the tone
 * has to come through the surface, not just the label. These two alphas are what
 * carries it, and they are deliberately one pair per material rather than per
 * component so a tinted button, tab bar, and card agree about how strongly a
 * tint reads.
 *
 * The alpha falls as the material gets heavier because a heavier material is
 * already doing more of the hiding: `glassSmall` is thin enough that the tint has
 * to carry the identity on its own, while `glassLarge` is most of the way to
 * opaque before the tint is applied at all.
 *
 * `tintOpacityPressed` is the whole press response for a tinted glass surface —
 * the colour deepens instead of a grey wash landing on top, which is the one
 * press treatment that does not stop the surface reading as glass.

 * Convert `#RRGGBB` to `rgba(r,g,b,a)`.
 *
 * Mirrors `rgbaFromHex` in `@arloui/tokens`, and lives here for the same reason
 * every value in this file does: what the CLI copies into a consumer project has
 * to stand on its own. Chart marks reach for it to fade a series colour — a
 * dimmed bar, a gradient stop, a heatmap cell — none of which can hardcode an
 * `rgba()` string when the hue comes from a token.
 *
 * Components must import it from here (`../../foundation/tokens`) rather than
 * from `@arloui/tokens`: that package is a workspace dependency of this repo,
 * not of the app the files are copied into.
