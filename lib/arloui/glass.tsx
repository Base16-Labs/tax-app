/**
 * Arlo UI — Liquid Glass
 *
 * One place that decides what a glass surface is actually made of, and turns a
 * material token into the fill, border, and blur strength a component paints.
 * Every glass-capable component (Button, Card, Sheet, TabBar, Tabs) resolves through
 * `useGlassSurface` and mounts `GlassBackdrop`, so the material reads identically
 * across the system and only has to be retuned once.
 *
 * There are two implementations behind that seam:
 *
 *   1. **Native.** On iOS 26 and up, `expo-glass-effect` exposes the real system
 *      material — a live, refractive, specular surface the OS renders. Nothing in
 *      React Native reproduces it, so where it exists we hand the surface over
 *      wholesale and paint nothing of our own on top.
 *   2. **Arlo's own.** Everywhere else — older iOS, Android, web, Expo Go, or a
 *      project that simply never installed `expo-glass-effect` — a translucent
 *      overlay from `materials.*` over a host blur layer.
 *
 * Components do not choose between them and must not try to. They ask for a
 * material; this file decides. That is what keeps `surface="glass"` a single
 * concept rather than an iOS feature with a sad Android branch.
 *
 * ## `expo-glass-effect` requires the New Architecture
 *
 * The graceful degradation below is a **runtime** guarantee, and only that. It
 * covers not having the package, not having the native module, being on Android,
 * and being on an iOS older than 26 — but it cannot cover the build.
 *
 * `GlassView` overrides `mountChildComponentView` / `unmountChildComponentView`,
 * which only exist on `ExpoView` under Fabric. In an app with
 * `newArchEnabled: false`, autolinking still compiles the pod and Swift fails
 * with "method does not override any method from its superclass" — a broken
 * build, not a fallback.
 *
 * So: install `expo-glass-effect` only in a New Architecture app. An old-arch
 * project that wants the rest of Arlo keeps the package out and gets the
 * fallback path, which is fully supported and needs nothing installed. If it
 * arrives transitively, exclude it from autolinking in `package.json`:
 *
 *   { "expo": { "autolinking": { "exclude": ["expo-glass-effect"] } } }
 *
 * ## Who paints what
 *
 * `GlassBackdrop` paints the whole surface: the fill, the tint, and the press
 * response. The component takes only the edge and the shape, and never sets a
 * `backgroundColor` of its own on a glass container — a fill there stacks under
 * the backdrop's and turns the material into an almost-opaque panel.
 *
 *   const glass = useGlassSurface('medium');
 *   <View style={{
 *     borderColor: glass.borderColor,
 *     borderWidth: glass.borderWidth,
 *     borderRadius: radius,
 *     overflow: 'hidden',
 *   }}>
 *     <GlassBackdrop material="medium" borderRadius={radius} tintColor={tone} pressed={pressed}>
 *       {blurComponent}
 *     </GlassBackdrop>
 *     …
 *   </View>

/**
 * Reduce Transparency, as one answer for the whole app.
 *
 * This deliberately is **not** per-component state. It used to be: every

 * `isReduceTransparencyEnabled()` probe. That is one store per hook call, and a
 * glass component calls the hook at least twice — once in the component for its
 * border and fill, once inside `GlassBackdrop` for the material itself. Two
 * stores resolving independently can disagree for a frame, and when they
 * disagree the component paints a fallback fill underneath a system material, or
 * hands `GlassBackdrop` a `native` answer its parent has not taken yet. Both
 * read on screen as the surface changing on its own, with nothing touched.
 *
 * A module-level store with a single subscription cannot do that: every consumer
 * reads the same value in the same render, so the surface only ever changes when
 * the setting actually changes.
 *
 * The OS subscription is intentionally never torn down. It is one listener for
 * the process, and dropping it when the last glass component unmounts would just
 * mean re-probing — and re-flickering — the next time one mounts.
 *
 * Glass is the material this setting is aimed at, so it outranks the native
 * path: someone who has asked the OS to stop making surfaces see-through should
 * not be handed the most see-through surface we own because their phone happens
 * to be new enough to render it well. When it is on we fall back, and the
 * fallback's own overlay is what carries the surface.

 * an almost-opaque panel wearing a glass token. Take `borderColor`,
 * `borderWidth`, and `borderRadius` from `useGlassSurface`; leave the fill here.
 *
 * On iOS 26 this is the system material, handed the theme's colour scheme
 * explicitly rather than `'auto'` — Arlo has its own `ThemeProvider`, so a user
 * reading a light app on a dark-mode phone must get light glass, and `'auto'`
 * would follow the OS and get it wrong.
 *
 * Everywhere else it is a host blur layer with the material's translucent fill
 * stacked *on top* of it. The order matters. A fill on the parent paints under
 * every child, so the blur layer ends up sampling the fill along with the content
 * behind the surface — and because host blurs are vibrancy effects (`expo-blur`
 * uses `saturate(180%)` on web, `UIBlurEffect` boosts chroma on iOS), the surface
 * comes back carrying an amplified cast of whatever passes beneath it. Over white
 * that reads as nothing; over anything coloured it reads as a coloured reflection
 * sliding across the glass. Fill above blur keeps the material muting the
 * backdrop instead of the other way round.
 *
 * With no `material` and no blur layer this renders nothing, so a glass surface
 * degrades to whatever the parent paints rather than breaking.
 *
 * The parent must set `overflow: 'hidden'` and its own `borderRadius` — the
 * backdrop fills the parent's bounds and is clipped by it. Pass the same radius
 * as `borderRadius` too: `UIGlassEffect` builds its lit edge from the shape it is
 * given, and a rectangular material clipped to a pill loses that edge and reads
 * as a flat cut-out that shifts as the backdrop moves behind it.
