/**
 * Arlo UI — Meter
 *
 * One value against a target: budget used, storage filled, goal progress. This is
 * a magnitude, not a category, so it is a single hue rather than a series colour —
 * and a `bar`, a `ring`, or an `arc`, which are the same data with different
 * shapes.
 *
 *   <Meter value={72} max={100} label="Storage" />
 *   <Meter shape="ring" value={1840} max={2000} label="Steps" tone="positive" />
 *   <Meter shape="arc" value={712} max={850} label="Credit score" />
 *
 * `arc` is the gauge: the same sweep as the ring with the bottom third left
 * open. It is the shape a score wants — a credit rating, a sleep score, a
 * readiness number — because the gap gives the value somewhere to sit and reads
 * as a dial rather than as progress towards a full circle.
 *
 * `rings` puts more than one value on the same dial, drawn concentrically:
 *
 *   <Meter value={520} max={600} rings={[{ value: 32, max: 40 }]} />
 *
 * That is the one arrangement composition cannot reach. Three meters side by
 * side are three readings; three rings on one dial are a single one.
 *
 * Passing `warnAt` / `dangerAt` moves it onto the status palette, which is
 * reserved for state and always ships with a visible value — never colour alone.
 *
 * The fill sweeps up from empty on mount and on every value change, and the
 * readout counts with it, so the number and the shape always agree mid-flight.
 * It runs on the `slow` duration rather than `base`: a meter is read as a
 * quantity, and a fill that lands before the eye reaches it may as well be
 * static. Reduce Motion pins both straight to the final value.
