/**
 * Arlo UI — BarChart
 *
 * Categorical magnitude: spend per day, sessions per channel. Bars are the right
 * form when the categories are discrete and the comparison is "which is bigger" —
 * use `Chart` instead when the x-axis is continuous time.
 *
 *   <Chart.Bar data={[{ label: 'M', value: 32 }, { label: 'T', value: 18 }]} />
 *
 * One chart, three prop families rather than three components:
 *
 *   <Chart.Bar data={sleep} series={[activity]} variant="grouped" legend={['Sleep', 'Activity']} />
 *   <Chart.Bar data={private_} series={[state]} variant="stacked" legend={['Private', 'State']} />
 *   <Chart.Bar data={spend} layout="horizontal" format={money} />
 *
 * Deliberate choices:
 *
 * - **Data-ends are rounded, the baseline end is not.** A bar is anchored to its
 *   axis; rounding the anchored end would lift it off and misreport where zero is.
 *   A stacked pile rounds only at its top — the interior joins are part of the
 *   same bar, not bars of their own.
 * - **Negatives drop below the baseline** rather than being drawn as magnitudes,
 *   and the baseline moves to wherever zero falls. A stacked bar is part-to-total,
 *   so negatives clamp to zero there — a negative share of a whole is not a thing.
 * - **One hue per series.** A single-series bar chart is magnitude, not identity,
 *   so it does not spend the categorical palette; `tone` steers it. The moment a
 *   second series arrives identity is the story, so every series takes its
 *   validated palette slot and `tone` is ignored.
 * - **Selection instead of hover.** Tapping a category reports it and shows its
 *   value; there is no hover on a touch screen. The categories not selected fade
 *   to a light tint of their own colours rather than dropping out, so the shape
 *   of the whole series survives while one category is being read.
 * - **Bars grow from the baseline on first paint**, staggered by category. A
 *   bar's height *is* its datum, so a later data change still cross-fades in
 *   place (`motion.chart.barSwap`) — growing on a period change would animate
 *   the number.
 * - **Layout is a prop, not a form.** `layout="horizontal"` draws the same
 *   categories as ranked rows — label, track, value — for any ranked breakdown.
 *   It renders the first series; ranking two series at once is a table's job.
 *
 * Each category is its own `Pressable`, sized by the same slot arithmetic that
 * places the mark, so the tap target and the rectangle are the same box by
 * construction rather than by agreement with a library's private layout.
