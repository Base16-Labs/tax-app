/**
 * Arlo UI — Chart
 *
 * A single-series line/area chart you scrub with your finger, for the "how is this
 * number doing" screen: a portfolio, a balance, a metric over time.
 *
 *   <Chart data={points} periods={['1D','1W','1M','1Y','ALL']} period={p} onPeriodChange={setP} />
 *
 * That is the whole call. With no children the chart renders its documented
 * composition — value, delta, plot, periods, in that order. Name the parts when
 * you need to reorder or drop one:
 *
 *   <Chart data={points} format={formatMoney('USD')}>
 *     <Chart.Plot height={180} />
 *     <Chart.Value />
 *     <Chart.Periods />
 *   </Chart>
 *
 * The other five forms hang off the same namespace, each a complete chart rather
 * than a part of the one above:
 *
 *   <Chart.Sparkline data={points} />        inline line, no chrome
 *   <Chart.Bar data={bars} />                categorical bars
 *   <Chart.Donut data={slices} />            part-to-whole, legend required
 *   <Chart.Meter value={n} max={m} />        one value against a target
 *   <Chart.Heatmap data={days} />            calendar grid, no library needed
 *
 * Deliberate choices:
 *
 * - **No axis furniture.** No ticks, no gridlines, no axis labels — there is no
 *   `Chart.Axis` part and there will not be one. The value readout is the label, and it
 *   updates as you scrub. A chart at this size answers "shape and direction", not
 *   "what exactly was Tuesday".
 * - **Direction, not identity.** One series, so no legend and no categorical
 *   palette — the tone is `chartPositive` / `chartNegative`, chosen by whether the
 *   series ended above or below the `baseline`. The exceptions are explicit: a
 *   `compare` line and a `range` band are drawn in the neutral and the brand hue
 *   respectively, and `Chart.Legend` names them.
 * - **Direction is never colour-alone.** `Chart.Delta` always renders a sign,
 *   because the two tones sit near the deuteranopia separation floor.
 * - **Straight segments by default.** A spline through sparse points invents peaks
 *   and troughs that were never in the data, so `Chart.Plot` joins points with
 *   straight lines unless you ask for `curve="smooth"`.
 *
 * Arlo draws all of this itself, on `react-native-svg`. The geometry lives in
 * `core.ts` and there is exactly one scale, which is what puts the crosshair on
 * the line rather than near it.

   * `{null}` is a deliberate empty tree — the bare mark, nothing around it.
   *
   * The plot's furniture is named the same way, inside `<Chart.Plot>`: the dashed
   * baseline is `<Chart.Baseline />`, the scrub crosshair is
   * `<Chart.Crosshair />`, and reference lines are one or more
   * `<Chart.Reference value={n} label="…" />` — one line, or the min/max pair a
