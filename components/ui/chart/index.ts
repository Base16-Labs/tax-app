/**
 * Every chart form is reached through the `Chart` namespace — `Chart.Sparkline`,
 * `Chart.Bar`, `Chart.Donut`, `Chart.Meter`, `Chart.Heatmap` — so only the props
 * types are named separately here. The components themselves stay exported from
 * their own files for anyone who copied a single form into their project.
 *
 * `core` is exported too. Arlo ships six forms and no more — candlestick, radar,
 * population pyramid, scatter, and 3-D are consumer-owned — so the scale and the
 * path builders the six are drawn with are public. A seventh form written against
 * them measures the same way these do.
 *
 * ## The parts
 *
 * Every form composes through children rather than boolean props. This is the
 * whole list, because it is otherwise spread across seven files and you are
 * reading the copy in your own project:
 *
 * | Form               | Parts                                                     |
 * | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
 * | `Chart`            | Value, Delta, Plot, Periods, Title, Legend, Empty          |
 * | `Chart.Plot`       | Baseline, Crosshair, Reference, Line, Bars                 |
 * | `Chart.Bar`        | Series, Amounts, Categories, Baseline, Reference, Legend   |
 * | `Chart.Donut`      | Value, Label, Legend                                       |
 * | `Chart.Meter`      | Value, Label, Ring                                         |
 * | `Chart.Heatmap`    | DayLabels, Scale                                           |
 * | `Chart.Sparkline`  | EndDot, Extremes, Fill                                     |
 *
 * `Value` means the same thing wherever it appears — *the* readout, one figure
 * for the whole chart. A label on every mark is `Amounts` on a bar chart,
 * `Categories` for the names beneath them, `DayLabels` on a heatmap: different
 * words because they are different things, not the same thing spelled three ways.
 *
 * **Naming any part replaces the whole default composition.** The tree is the
 * spec, not an addition to it, which is the only way to ask for a bare mark —
 * so `<Chart.Bar><Chart.Bar.Amounts /></Chart.Bar>` is a chart with amounts and
 * *nothing else*, no category labels and no zero rule. Spell the defaults out
 * alongside whatever you are adding, or pass `{null}` for a deliberately bare
 * mark. In dev the forms say which parts a tree turned off.

 * The namespace, assembled here rather than in `chart.tsx`.

 * barrel. Building the namespace inside `chart.tsx` made the *plot* depend on
 * them too, which is why the registry could only ever ship charts as one
 * thirteen-file lump. Installing `chart-bar` on its own now pulls the bar chart
 * and the shared core, and nothing else.
