/**
 * Every chart form is reached through the `Chart` namespace — `Chart.Sparkline`,
 * `Chart.Bar`, `Chart.Donut`, `Chart.Meter`, `Chart.Heatmap` — so only the props
 * types are named separately here. The components themselves stay exported from
 * their own files for anyone who copied a single form into their project.
 *
 * `core` is exported too. Arlo ships six forms and no more — candlestick, radar,
 * population pyramid, scatter, and 3-D are consumer-owned — so the scale and the
 * path builders the six are drawn with are public. A seventh form written against
 * them measures the same way these do.
 */
// The plot half is already assembled in `chart.tsx`, so a standalone
// `chart-plot` install gets the same `Chart` the examples use. This adds the
// other five forms to that same object.

/**
 * The namespace, assembled here rather than in `chart.tsx`.
 *
 * This file is the one place that legitimately depends on every form — it is the
 * barrel. Building the namespace inside `chart.tsx` made the *plot* depend on
 * them too, which is why the registry could only ever ship charts as one
 * thirteen-file lump. Installing `chart-bar` on its own now pulls the bar chart
 * and the shared core, and nothing else.
