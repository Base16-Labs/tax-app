/**
 * Arlo UI — Chart.Legend
 *
 * The identity row every multi-series form shares: `Chart.Bar` with two series,
 * `Chart.Plot` with a `compare` line or a `range` band. Swatch and label, laid
 * out in the order the series are drawn, because a legend that reads in a
 * different order than the marks is worse than none.
 *
 * It exists as a standalone export because the compare plot composes its own
 * chrome — the legend can't live inside the plot there — while `Chart.Bar`
 * mounts the same component when given `legend` labels. One legend, so both
 * forms read the same.
 *
 * Identity is never colour alone: the label is the identity, the swatch is the
 * pointer. That is also why there is no icon-only or swatch-only mode.
